    "## What is Multiple Dispatch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some handy definitions\n",
    "* **function**: the name of the \"function / process\" we are referring to.\n",
    "* **method**: what actually happens when we call the function with a specific combination of input arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Dispatch* means that when a function call occurs, the language decides somehow which of the function *methods* have to be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "### No dispatch\n",
    "In no dispatch, as in e.g. C, there is nothing to be decided. The method and the function are one and the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Single dispatch\n",
    "In single dispatch, as in most object-oriented languages (like Python), it is possible for the same function name to have different methods:\n",
    "```\n",
    "array.set_size(args...)\n",
    "axis.set_size(args...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `array` could be an instance of something from `numpy` while `axis` could come from `matplotlib`. Here the language dispatches the function `set_size`, depending on the first argument, which is `array` or `axis`. It is important to note that in most object oriented languages, the **method is a property of the type**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple dispatch\n",
    "Here dispatch occurs based on the type of **every single function argument**, as in\n",
    "```\n",
    "set_size(a::Array, args...) = ...\n",
    "set_size(a::Axis, args...) = ...\n",
    "set_size(s, a::Array, args...) = ...\n",
    "set_size(a::Array, b::Vector) = ...\n",
    "set_size(a::Array, x::Real, y::Real, z::Real) = ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "etc. This means that multiple dispatch allows for more exponentially more \"expressive power\", as one can use all arguments of the function to dispatch on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple dispatch follows easy-to-understand rules based on the Julia type system hierarchy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon calling a function, Julia will try to find the method that is most specific across all arguments. This means that if a method is defined for both the abstract type combination, as well as the concrete type combination, Julia will always call the more concrete one. This rule also applies to e.g. parametric types, since `Vector{Float64}` is more specialized than `Vector`. This rule also applies to unions, since `Float64` is more specialized than `Union{Float64, String}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **methods do not belong to the Types!**\n",
    "2. **new methods can be defined *after* the Types have been defined!**"
